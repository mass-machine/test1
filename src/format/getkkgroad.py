    Please optimize the path length for paths longer than 10 based on the given paths,Each word represents a unit of length, with the following requirements
    1.Redundancy Removal: Eliminating duplicate or semantically similar nodes to streamline paths.
        How to do: Remove duplicate nodes or words with similar meanings.
            • E.g.: "A→B→B→C" → Simplify to "A→B→C"
            • E.g.: Merge synonyms ("happy→joyful→pleased" → Unify as "happy")
            Target: Reduces path length and avoids redundancy.
    2.Structural Adjustment:Reordering entities to enhance reasoning clarity.
        How to do: Reorder nodes to follow logical sequences (e.g., time order, cause-effect).
            • E.g.: "rain→wet ground→bring umbrella" → Adjust to "rain→bring umbrella→wet ground"
            Target: Improves coherence and readability.
    3.Path Reconstruction:Merging sub-paths to retain key information while ensuring coherence.
        How to do: Merge sub-paths, keeping only essential nodes.
            • E.g.: "study→review→exam→pass exam→celebrate" → Simplify to "study→exam→celebrate"
            Target: Preserves key information while shortening the path.
